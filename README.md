# Weather Monitoring

The goal of this project is to develop a real-time data processing system that continuously monitors weather conditions and provides summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. The system will utilize data from the OpenWeatherMap API to ensure accurate and timely information.

## Data Source
The system will retrieve weather data continuously from the OpenWeatherMap API. Users must sign up for a free API key to access the data. The focus of this project will be on the following weather parameters:

main: Main weather condition (e.g., Rain, Snow, Clear)
temp: Current temperature in degrees Celsius
feels_like: Perceived temperature in degrees Celsius
dt: Time of the data update (Unix timestamp)

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
